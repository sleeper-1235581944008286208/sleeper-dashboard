  "summary": "Right, let's get into this absolute shambles of a week, shall we?\n\nFinthefiddle put on a masterclass with 203.98 points. That's how you do it. Christian McCaffrey with 45.1, Jahmyr Gibbs with 42.8 - two elite running backs delivering elite performances. This is what happens when you've got proper players and they do their jobs. But look at poor chitown314 on the other end, getting absolutely battered by 80.74 points. The Browns defense scored 28.4 for him and he still got demolished. That tells you everything. When your defense is your best player and you lose by 81 points, you've got serious problems. And decdweir - \"The Invisible Man\" they should call him - putting up 76.48 points. George Kittle with zero? Zero! You're starting one of the best tight ends in the league and he gives you nothing. That's criminal. Mac Jones as your quarterback scoring 12.2? What are we doing here? This isn't fantasy football, it's fantasy nightmare.\n\nBigBishAl76 beats Tmac1418 despite the Jacksonville Jaguars defense putting up -3.2 points. Minus points from your defense! That's like scoring an own goal and then falling over. But fair play, Trey McBride with 25.4 and Chris Olave with 25.3 bailed him out. That's called having proper talent. Meanwhile, stevenbar24 - call him \"The Bench Warmer\" because he left 22.2 points sitting there doing nothing - still managed to win because Jonathan Taylor went off for 38.7. Sometimes you get lucky. But don't mistake luck for competence. Those lineup decisions are shocking. Cam Little at kicker getting you zero points? You've got to be better than that.\n\nNiallCarslaw sneaking past stephen375 by 8.6 points in the week's only close game. Ja'Marr Chase with 34.1 points - that's world class. That's what winners look like. But then you've got Luke McCaffrey with zero and TreVeyon Henderson with 0.5. It's like watching Manchester United - moments of brilliance surrounded by absolute mediocrity. ChunkyDog1998 demolished mikeybhoy by 46.02 points, and this one's the tale of two stories. Justin Herbert throws up 40.9 points for mikeybhoy - magnificent performance - and he still loses by 46! That's the fantasy football equivalent of scoring a hat-trick and losing 5-3. The Commanders defense giving him -1.0 didn't help, did it?\n\nBottom line: This week separated the men from the boys. Finthefiddle is on a two-week hot streak averaging 170.6 points - that's dominance. That's consistency at the highest level. Then you've got jamesclarkson96 trending down on a three-week cold streak, mikeybhoy dropping for three straight weeks. These aren't accidents. It's about making the right decisions week in, week out. Cooper Kupp with 2.2 points for MarkusArnold? Mike Evans and George Kittle with zeros? These are supposed to be your best players. When they don't show up, you don't show up. No excuses. Do your job or get out of the way.",
