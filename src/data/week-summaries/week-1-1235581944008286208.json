  "summary": "Right, let me tell you something about Week 1 - this was a masterclass in how to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, and some of you lot should be ashamed of yourselves.\n\nLet's start with the absolute carnage at the top. Mikeybhoy put up 154 points and that's how you make a statement - Josh Allen with 48.8 points, absolutely running riot. That's what elite players do. Then you've got \"The Undertaker\" MarkusArnold absolutely burying jdmorris by 44.8 points. Justin Fields with 36.5, Travis Etienne with 20.6 - that's a proper battering. But here's the thing that does my head in: MarkusArnold still left nearly 15 points on the bench with poor lineup decisions. Won by 45 and still made mistakes. Unacceptable. And don't get me started on finthefiddle - top of the power rankings at 92, scored 124.78 points, and \"The Bottler\" still lost to jamesclarkson96 by 2.38 points. Two points! That's the kind of heartbreak that keeps you up at night, and frankly, when you're that heavily favored, you've got no excuses.\n\nThe quarterback play this week was outstanding, I'll give credit where it's due. Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson with 36.4, Justin Fields, Jalen Hurts with 32.3, Caleb Williams with 31.7 - these lads turned up and did the business. That's what separates winners from losers. But then you look at the other end of the spectrum and it's embarrassing. Kaleb Johnson with MINUS 0.2 points? Xavier Worthy and Jaydon Blue with absolute zeroes? If you started these players, you need to have a long, hard look at yourself in the mirror. This is professional fantasy football, not a charity.\n\nChunkyDog1998 scraped past danielb6 by less than five points, and I'll tell you what - when you've got A.J. Brown putting up 1.3 points, you don't deserve to win. Garrett Wilson bailed you out with 20.5, simple as that. One man show. And what about BigBishAl76? Second in the power rankings, 112 points, and you lose to Tmac1418? Javonte Williams gave you 22.4 and you still couldn't get it done. That's not good enough. The bench decisions this week were absolutely criminal across the board - raaaaaidddderrrrrs left 17.1 points on the bench and only won by 6.36. You got lucky, sunshine. Pure luck.\n\nBottom line: Three matches decided by under 10 points, which means discipline and decision-making matter. Some of you turned up - mikeybhoy, MarkusArnold, stevenbar24 with 125.5 points - you lot understood the assignment. The rest of you? Sort yourselves out. Check your lineups, back your best players, and stop leaving points on the bench like it's going out of fashion. Week 2 is coming and there's no room for passengers. Do better.",
