  "summary": "Welcome back, fantasy footballers. Week 5 is in the books, and let me tell you something—we had performances that ranged from \"You can't stop him, you can only hope to contain him\" to \"You can't help him, you can only hope to watch something else.\" \n\nLet's start at the top where mjgrana dropped 173 points on tr4sh like it was a video game on rookie mode. Kyren Williams put up 27, Baker Mayfield added another 27, and suddenly we're watching the Rams' entire offense win someone's fantasy week. En fuego doesn't even begin to describe it. Meanwhile, cosmohouck—sitting pretty at #1 in the power rankings—put up 134 behind Jonathan Taylor's league-leading 30-burger. Taylor's out here reminding everyone why you draft running backs early, folks. You simply cannot stop this man. The league average was 111 points this week, which means someone had to balance out all this success, and that someone was Langland. Forty points. Four-zero. Spencer Rattler and Calvin Ridley combined for 31 of those 40 points, which means the rest of the roster contributed... well, let's just say Jalen Tolbert and Dont'e Thornton registered goose eggs and move on with our lives. Tishathefish won that matchup by nearly 66 points, the biggest blowout of the week. It wasn't a game; it was a public service announcement.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting, though. We've got mastab24 riding a three-week hot streak, knocking off drobs despite James Cook's pedestrian 4.9 points. Rachaad White saved the day with 21 points—you start wondering if White's finally arrived, or if this is just another tease. Drobs, meanwhile, is on a two-week cold streak despite having Patrick Mahomes throw for 26.7 points. When Mahomes goes for 27 and you still lose, that's when you start questioning your life choices and your waiver wire strategy. Let's call drobs \"The Underachiever\" right now—talented roster, can't close games. And speaking of nicknames, PrinceofPizza just became \"The Junk Food King\" after winning with Daniel Jones and Darren Waller leading the way. Yes, that Darren Waller. That Daniel Jones. Sometimes you eat pizza, sometimes pizza eats you, and somehow you still win by 19.\n\nBut the real story here is the brewing rivalry between Shogunation and cosmohouck at the top of the standings. Shogunation dropped 131 this week with Dak Prescott's 28 points, sitting at #4 in the power rankings. Cosmohouck's at #1, averaging 124 points per game as a consistent scorer. These two are on a collision course, and when they meet, someone's undefeated season—or hot streak—is going to end badly. It's the irresistible force meeting the immovable object, except both teams can score and neither one's playing defense because, well, this is fantasy football.\n\nWeek 5: Where Jonathan Taylor reminded us he's still that guy, where Langland reminded us that sometimes you should just stay in bed, and where mjgrana's 173 points proved that in fantasy football, you don't need a close game to have a good time—you just need a box score that looks like a phone number. You can't stop these teams, you can only hope to outscore them. And if you're Langland, you can't even hope for that.",
