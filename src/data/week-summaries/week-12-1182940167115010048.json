  "summary": "OH BOY! OH BOY! Ladies and gentlemen, hold onto your headsets because what we just witnessed in Week 12 was absolutely UNPRECEDENTED in fantasy football history! Not so fast, my friend – you think you've seen everything in fantasy? Well, let me tell you something: EVERY SINGLE MATCHUP ended in a GOOSE EGG! Zero points! Nada! Zilch! It's like watching six teams show up to the stadium and forget to bring their playbooks! This is the kind of week that makes you want to check if your internet connection died, but nope – this actually happened, folks!\n\nLet me break down these \"nail-biters\" for you – and when I say nail-biters, I mean EVERY GAME came down to a 0.00 margin! UH OH! Langland squeaked past drobs, cosmohouck edged powerperson, and Tishathefish – who I'm calling \"The Sushi Special\" because she served up a cold plate of nothing – somehow defeated mastab24! But here's where it gets REALLY interesting, my friends: we've got ourselves a RIVALRY brewing between tr4sh and Shogunation! Both teams put up matching bagels, but tr4sh takes the W! I'm telling you right now, Shogunation is going to remember this one. This is the kind of defeat that keeps you up at night, staring at the ceiling, wondering what could have been!\n\nNOT SO FAST, MY FRIEND! You might be thinking, \"Lee, how do we crown a champion when everyone scored zero?\" Well, that's the beautiful chaos of fantasy football! PrinceofPizza – or should I say the \"Duke of Disappointment\" after this performance – got blanked by Seananigans, while mjgrana fell to TophTT in what can only be described as a race to the bottom that nobody wanted to win! The average score was 0.00, the highest score was 0.00, and folks, I've been doing this for DECADES and I've NEVER seen anything like it! Six games, ALL decided by 0.00 points, ALL classified as \"close games!\" This is either the most competitive week in fantasy history or we just witnessed the greatest collective faceplant since New Coke!\n\nHere's what I'm telling you, people: Week 13 better bring the FIREWORKS because this league needs a PULSE CHECK! Somebody needs to wake up these offenses, check those waiver wires, and FOR THE LOVE OF BOBBY BOWDEN, score some POINTS! Will tr4sh and Shogunation meet again in the playoffs? Can the Duke of Disappointment reclaim his throne? Will The Sushi Special keep serving up victories? OH BOY, I can't wait to find out! Remember folks, in fantasy football, it's not over until Lee Corso puts on the headgear – and right now, I'd be putting on a GOOSE! *Makes honking sounds* Not so fast, Week 13 – show us what you've got!",
