  "summary": "**Week 16: Where Blowouts Ruled and Rosters Went to Die**\n\nYou know, they say in fantasy football you need your studs to show up when it matters most. Well, mjgrana got that memo—Chase Brown dropped 30.9, Christian McCaffrey put up 29.6, and suddenly cosmohouck's 133.7 looked like pocket change. That's a 38.86-point beatdown, folks. And here's the thing: mjgrana won despite getting a combined 13.1 points from Colby Parkinson and Kyren Williams. When you can afford to have two players ghost you and still win by nearly 40, well... you can't stop him, you can only hope to contain him. Cosmohouck's got Brock Purdy throwing for 30.9 and Bijan Robinson going for 26.3, and it's still not enough. Brian Thomas putting up 2.8? That's not a wide receiver stat, that's a kicker having an off day.\n\nLet's talk about \"The Pizza Delivery Man\"—PrinceofPizza served up a piping hot 149.34 against Shogunation's 126.16. Chris Olave went absolutely en fuego with 31.8 points, and Ashton Jeanty reminded everyone why you draft him with 31.3 of his own. This team's riding a two-week hot streak and trending up at exactly the right time. Sure, TreVeyon Henderson gave them a whopping 1.7 points—I've seen better production from a practice squad water boy—but when your top guys go nuclear, you can afford a dud or two. Meanwhile, Shogunation got 30.2 from Justin Herbert and 22.8 from Derrick Henry and still lost. Sometimes you bring a knife to a gunfight, and sometimes you bring Drake London's 4.2 points to a playoff game.\n\nThen there's Seananigans—and I'm calling this guy \"The Puka Prince\" after this performance—who absolutely demolished Tishathefish by 39.98 points. Puka Nacua dropped 40.5 on Christmas, which is the kind of gift that keeps on giving all the way to a championship. Jaylen Warren chipped in 28.1 for good measure. Tishathefish has been trending up all season, recent average of 114.3, but they picked the wrong week to score 87.82. When your best players are Jaxon Smith-Njigba's 19.6 and Tyjae Spears' 19.0, and you're facing someone whose *one* receiver outscored your entire starting lineup... well, that's not a game, that's a crime scene.\n\nBut the massacre of the week? That belongs to powerperson, who just obliterated TophTT 107.42 to 56.12. That's a 51.30-point margin, folks—the biggest blowout of the week in a week full of blowouts. Not a single game was decided by fewer than 23 points. TophTT rolled out Dalton Kincaid, who gave them a goose egg. Zero points. You know what zero points gets you? A long offseason and a lot of questions. George Kittle tried his best with 21.0 points, but when you're spotting the other team 50 points, even Jerry Rice in his prime isn't saving you. Meanwhile, powerperson is riding a three-week hot streak, trending up from an 83.5 season average to a recent 104.0. That's what we call peaking at the right time—or as I like to say, they're en fuego, and TophTT couldn't stop them. They couldn't even hope to contain them.",
