  "summary": "Right then, Week 5 is in the books, and what an absolute rollercoaster of emotions we've had. Let me tell you, I've seen some things in my time – awkward robot celebrations, being two meters tall trying to play in a phone box – but BigBishAl76 putting up 188.44 points against MarkusArnold's respectable 134.82? That's the kind of thrashing that makes you question your life choices. Kyren Williams and Javonte Williams combined for 63 points in the backfield, which is just obscene really. Both Williams lads absolutely ran riot, and I respect the audacity of riding that train. Meanwhile, MarkusArnold had Justin Fields drop nearly 35 points and still lost by 53.62. That's the fantasy football equivalent of scoring a bicycle kick and your team still losing 5-1. Brutal.\n\nSpeaking of statement victories, can we talk about our hero of the week? Step forward \"Rico Suave\" raaaaaidddderrrrrs, who absolutely demolished NiallCarslaw 163.96 to 98.5. That 65.46-point margin is the biggest blowout of the week, and it came courtesy of Rico Dowdle's league-leading 39.4 points and Baker Mayfield's 35.2. Now, I've always had a soft spot for Baker – bit of swagger, bit of chaos – and this week he delivered. Poor NiallCarslaw had Ja'Marr Chase putting up 28.5 and still got battered. When your running back Ollie Gordon finishes on -0.2 points, you know it's not your day. That's the kind of performance that has you staring at the ceiling at 3am wondering why you do this to yourself.\n\nOn the flip side, our villain of the week – and I say this with love – has to be the Baltimore Ravens defense, who somehow managed to score -2.0 points for chitown314. Minus two! I've had some questionable moments on a football pitch, but at least I never went backwards into my own net. The Ravens managed to be worse than doing nothing, which is genuinely impressive in its own way. ChiTown also had Miles Sanders put up a beautiful 0.0, which combined with that defensive disaster helped stevenbar24 cruise to a 148.56-105.14 victory. Jonathan Taylor and Matthew Stafford both dropped 33.1 points each for stevenbar24, proving that sometimes fantasy football is just about your stars actually turning up.\n\nThe league's top dog finthefiddle – sitting pretty at #1 in the power rankings with a ridiculous 92 rating – continued their three-week hot streak by dispatching jamesclarkson96 151.72 to 116.76. Emeka Egbuka and Jaxon Smith-Njigba combined for 57 points, which is the kind of receiving corps performance that makes you feel all warm inside. Shoutout to bequietamy for squeezing out a 9.02-point victory over stephen375 in the week's closest match, proving that sometimes survival is enough. Stephen375's Jacory Croskey-Merritt dropped 31 points and still came up short – that's got to sting like a poorly-timed tackle in the box. All in all, Week 5 reminded us why we love this beautiful, frustrating game. Same time next week? Brilliant.",
