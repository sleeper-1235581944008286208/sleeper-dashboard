  "summary": "Right, let's get stuck into Week 11, and what an absolute cracker of a week it was for some, while others will want to forget it ever happened.\n\nAt the top of the table, finthefiddle is doing what champions do – they're putting teams away with authority. A 155-point performance with Christian McCaffrey delivering 38.6 points is exactly what you pay premium draft capital for. That's clinical finishing. And here's the thing about finthefiddle – they're averaging 168.6 over their last five weeks on a three-week hot streak. That's frightening form. Meanwhile, BigBishAl76 absolutely demolished stephen375 by 67 points, and you can see why they're trending upward. Trey McBride with 24.5 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defense putting up 23.2 – that's what I call a complete performance. Poor stephen375 is in freefall, five weeks of cold form, and they've dropped from a season average of 107.8 down to just 90.2 recently. That's relegation form, that is.\n\nNow, let's talk about Josh Allen – 50.7 points! That's not just a performance, that's a statement. Mikeybhoy rode that Allen masterclass to a 44-point thrashing of jamesclarkson96, who's now on a three-week cold streak. When your quarterback puts up 50 and you've got TreVeyon Henderson chipping in 32.3, you're going to win football matches – simple as that. On the flip side, Khalil Shakir with 0.2 points and Quentin Johnston with a big fat zero – those are the kinds of performances that cost you leagues. You cannot carry passengers at this level. Decdweir keeps rolling along nicely with Bijan Robinson (33.8) and George Kittle (23.2) doing the business, while jdmorris is trending the wrong way despite Dak Prescott's 30.3. At the end of the day, when you've got Ricky Pearsall giving you 0.5 points, you're not winning matches.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting for next week: we've got a brewing rivalry between finthefiddle at #1 in the power rankings (92 points!) and BigBishAl76 at #2 (60.5). These two are the class of the league, and if they meet in the playoffs, it's going to be box office. Finthefiddle's got McCaffrey firing on all cylinders, but BigBishAl76 is on that four-week hot streak and averaging 161.2 – that's champion-level consistency. My bold prediction? Stevenbar24, currently ranked #3 but coming off an 88-point disaster, bounces back in spectacular fashion next week. Class is permanent, and their 142.1 season average tells you they're better than that shocker against danielb6. They'll be fuming after putting up a goose egg with the Chargers defense and will come out swinging.\n\nThis week proved one thing: you can have all the talent in the world, but if your big names don't deliver, you're going home empty-handed. Josh Allen put on a show, McCaffrey reminded everyone he's still the best in the business, and Sean Tucker came out of nowhere with 36 points for bequietamy. That's fantasy football – brutal, unforgiving, and absolutely brilliant. As for those managers making shocking lineup decisions, leaving points on the bench? That's the difference between winning and losing, and in this league, there's no room for sentiment – only results matter.",
