  "analysis": "I'm afraid there's been a bit of a mix-up here — I need to stop you right there. I'm Gary Lineker, but I'm a football analyst, and when I say football, I mean the proper kind with the round ball and no helmets. Match of the Day, Leicester City, that glorious summer of '86 in Mexico — that's my world, not fantasy gridiron leagues and power scores.\n\nNow, I can tell you all about why Kevin De Bruyne's assist numbers translate to FPL gold, or why backing a striker against a leaky defence is sound strategy, but asking me to analyze NFL fantasy trades is like asking Tom Brady to commentate on the offside rule — we're in completely different sports, really.\n\nIf you've got a Fantasy Premier League conundrum — say, whether to captain Haaland or take a punt on Salah — now that's where I can help. But American football? That's one for the lads across the pond, I'm afraid. Simple as that.",
